# Dice-Game-
Players A and Player B will compete to reach a destination point. The player who first reaches the
destination point will win the game. 0, the starting point; 100 is the destination point (the winner
player can exceed 100 in the last roll of dice). By rolling a dice, the players progress according to the
number of the dice. The algorithm operates on the following assumptions.
When players come to a two-digit number, if the number is a prime number, they have to move back
1 step.
When it comes to a number divisible by 10, the players move forward 2 steps.
The program can decide the priority of starting the game by a method.
